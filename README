All the codes are in code directory. 
proj2.m was modified a little bit to fix the reverse x and y vector. 
Some results are stored in the code direactory but not shown in the web-publish result.
Nearest Neighbor Ratio Test was modified to include third nearest point.
The algorithm can be run with grayscale and color images but will take much longer to process with color image because the amount of interested points are almost three times and each feature will take three time to calculate.

Thank you.
